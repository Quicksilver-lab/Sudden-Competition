### Introduction to Simple Harmonic Motion
SHM is a periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.

### Characteristics of SHM
1. **Period (T)**: The time for one complete cycle.
2. **Frequency (f)**: The number of cycles per second.
3. **Amplitude (A)**: The maximum displacement.
4. **Phase Constant (\( \phi \))**: Indicates the initial position.

### Mathematical Formulation
\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]

### Energy in SHM
The total mechanical energy is conserved and consists of kinetic and potential energy.

### Types of Waves
1. **Mechanical Waves**: Require a medium.
2. **Electromagnetic Waves**: Do not require a medium.

### Wave Properties
1. **Wavelength (\( \lambda \))**: Distance between consecutive points in phase.
2. **Wave Speed (v)**: Speed at which the wave propagates.
   \[
   v = f \lambda
   \]

### Short Questions
1. Define SHM.
2. Relationship between period and frequency.
3. Explain amplitude in SHM.
4. Differentiate between mechanical and electromagnetic waves.

### Long Questions
1. Derive the equation of motion for SHM.
2. Discuss energy transformations in SHM.
3. Compare transverse and longitudinal waves.
