# Physics Chapter 10: Simple Harmonic Motion and Waves

## Important Questions and Answers

### 1. Define Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).
**Answer**: SHM is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement.

### 2. What is frequency? 
**Answer**: Frequency is the number of oscillations or vibrations per unit time. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).

### 3. Define Time Period and Amplitude.
- **Time Period**: The time taken to complete one full oscillation or cycle.
- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement from the mean position during SHM.

### 4. Explain the concept of wave and wavelength.
- **Wave**: A disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another without transferring matter.
- **Wavelength**: The distance between two consecutive points in phase, such as crest to crest or trough to trough.

### 5. What are compressional waves?
**Answer**: Compressional waves are mechanical waves where the particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave. Sound waves in air are an example.

### 6. Define refraction in terms of waves.
**Answer**: Refraction is the bending of waves when they pass from one medium to another, due to a change in their speed.

### 7. What are damped oscillations?
**Answer**: Damped oscillations are oscillations where the amplitude decreases over time due to the loss of energy, usually from friction or resistance.

### 8. What is the difference between reflection, refraction, and diffraction of waves?
- **Reflection**: Bouncing back of waves when they hit a surface.
- **Refraction**: Bending of waves as they pass through different mediums.
- **Diffraction**: Spreading of waves as they pass through a narrow opening or around obstacles.

### 9. Types of Waves:
- **Mechanical Waves**: Require a medium to travel (e.g., sound waves).
- **Electromagnetic Waves**: Do not require a medium (e.g., light waves).
