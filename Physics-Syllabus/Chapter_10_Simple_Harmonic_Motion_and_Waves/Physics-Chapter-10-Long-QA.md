## Long Questions and Answers

### 1. Explain Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) in detail and derive the equation for SHM.
**Answer**: 
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement of the body from its mean position and is directed towards the mean position. The motion is periodic, meaning it repeats after regular intervals of time. 

#### Derivation of SHM Equation:
Consider a body of mass `m` attached to a spring on a frictionless surface. According to Hooke's Law, the restoring force `F` is proportional to the displacement `x`:
\[
F = -kx
\]
Where `k` is the spring constant. From Newtonâ€™s second law:
\[
F = ma
\]
Equating the two expressions gives:
\[
ma = -kx
\]
\[
a = \frac{-kx}{m}
\]
Since acceleration `a` is the second derivative of displacement with respect to time:
\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{-k}{m}x
\]
This is the standard form of the differential equation for SHM. Solving this yields:
\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)
\]
Where:
- `A` is the amplitude.
- `\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}` is the angular frequency.
- `\phi` is the phase constant.

### 2. Discuss the characteristics and types of waves. How are mechanical and electromagnetic waves different?
**Answer**: 
Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without transferring matter. There are two main types of waves:

- **Mechanical Waves**: These waves require a medium to travel, such as sound waves or water waves.
- **Electromagnetic Waves**: These waves do not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum, such as light waves and radio waves.

#### Types of Waves:
1. **Transverse Waves**: The particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples include light waves and water waves.
2. **Longitudinal Waves**: The particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves in air are an example.

#### Differences Between Mechanical and Electromagnetic Waves:
- **Medium**: Mechanical waves require a medium, while electromagnetic waves do not.
- **Speed**: Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, while the speed of mechanical waves depends on the medium.
- **Examples**: Sound is a mechanical wave, while light is an electromagnetic wave.

### 3. Explain the phenomena of reflection, refraction, and diffraction of waves.
**Answer**:
- **Reflection**: Reflection occurs when a wave hits a surface and bounces back. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This is commonly seen with light waves hitting a mirror.
  
- **Refraction**: Refraction is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium into another due to a change in their speed. For example, when light travels from air to water, it slows down and bends towards the normal.

- **Diffraction**: Diffraction occurs when a wave passes through a narrow opening or moves around an obstacle, causing the wave to spread out. This can be observed with sound waves passing through a small doorway.

### 4. Define damped oscillation. What are the different types of damping? Explain with examples.
**Answer**:
Damped oscillations occur when the amplitude of oscillations decreases over time due to an external force like friction or resistance. The energy of the system is gradually lost to the surroundings.

#### Types of Damping:
1. **Light Damping**: In this case, the system oscillates with gradually decreasing amplitude. An example is a simple pendulum swinging in the air.
2. **Critical Damping**: The system returns to equilibrium without oscillating. This type of damping is seen in door closers.
3. **Heavy Damping**: The system returns to equilibrium slowly without oscillating. This is seen in shock absorbers in cars.
