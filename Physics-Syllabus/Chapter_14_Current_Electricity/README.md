## Basic Concepts of Current

### What is Electric Current?
Electric current (\( I \)) is the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It is measured in Amperes (A).

### Formula:
\[
I = \frac{Q}{t}
\]
Where:
- \( I \) = current (A)
- \( Q \) = charge (C)
- \( t \) = time (s)

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law states that the current (\( I \)) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (\( V \)) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (\( R \)) of the conductor.

### Formula:
\[
V = I \times R
\]
Where:
- \( V \) = voltage (V)
- \( I \) = current (A)
- \( R \) = resistance (Ω)

## Circuit Components

1. **Resistor**: A component that resists the flow of current.
2. **Battery**: A source of voltage that provides the electric current.
3. **Switch**: A device used to open or close a circuit.

## Resistance and Resistivity

### What is Resistance?
Resistance (\( R \)) is a measure of the opposition to the flow of current in a conductor.

### Formula:
\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]

### Resistivity (\( \rho \))
Resistivity is a material property that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes the flow of electric current.

### Formula:
\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]
Where:
- \( R \) = resistance (Ω)
- \( \rho \) = resistivity (Ω·m)
- \( L \) = length of the conductor (m)
- \( A \) = cross-sectional area (m²)

## Series and Parallel Circuits

### Series Circuits
In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end, and the same current flows through all components.

- **Total Resistance**:
\[
R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots
\]

### Parallel Circuits
In a parallel circuit, components are connected across the same voltage source, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.

- **Total Resistance**:
\[
\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots
\]

## Electrical Power

Electrical power (\( P \)) is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or converted.

### Formula:
\[
P = V \times I
\]

### Alternate Formula:
Using Ohm's law, power can also be expressed as:
\[
P = I^2 R
\]
or
\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\]
