## Basic Concepts of Charge

### What is Charge?
Charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electric and magnetic field. Charges can be positive or negative.

- **Unit of Charge**: The SI unit is the Coulomb (C).

### Conservation of Charge
Charge cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred from one object to another. This principle is known as the conservation of charge.

## Types of Charge

1. **Positive Charge**: Carried by protons.
2. **Negative Charge**: Carried by electrons.

Like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract.

## Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's Law describes the force between two point charges. It states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force (\( F \)) between two charges (\( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \)) is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (\( r \)) between them.

### Formula:
\[
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]
Where:
- \( F \) = electrostatic force
- \( k \) = Coulomb's constant (\( k \approx 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 \))
- \( r \) = distance between the charges

### Direction of Force
- The force is attractive if the charges are opposite and repulsive if they are the same.

## Electric Field

### What is Electric Field?
An electric field (\( E \)) is a region around a charged object where other charged objects experience a force. 

### Formula:
\[
E = \frac{F}{q}
\]
Where:
- \( E \) = electric field strength
- \( F \) = force experienced by a small positive test charge
- \( q \) = magnitude of the test charge

### Direction of Electric Field
The electric field points away from positive charges and toward negative charges.

## Electric Potential

### What is Electric Potential?
Electric potential (\( V \)) is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field.

### Formula:
\[
V = k \frac{q}{r}
\]
Where:
- \( V \) = electric potential
- \( q \) = charge creating the potential
- \( r \) = distance from the charge

## Capacitance

### What is Capacitance?
Capacitance (\( C \)) is the ability of a system to store charge per unit voltage.

### Formula:
\[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\]
Where:
- \( C \) = capacitance
- \( Q \) = charge stored
- \( V \) = voltage across the capacitor

### Unit of Capacitance
The unit of capacitance is the Farad (F).
