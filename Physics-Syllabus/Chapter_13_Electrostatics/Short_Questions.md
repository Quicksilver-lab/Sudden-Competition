# Physics Chapter 13: Sound

## Important Questions and Answers

### 1. What is sound?
**Answer**: Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. It travels in the form of compressional waves through a medium such as air, water, or solids.

### 2. Define speed of sound and factors affecting it.
**Answer**: The speed of sound is the distance sound travels per unit of time. It is affected by factors like temperature, medium, and humidity. Sound travels faster in warmer temperatures and denser mediums.

### 3. What is the Doppler Effect?
**Answer**: The Doppler Effect is the change in frequency or pitch of a sound when the source or listener is moving relative to one another.

### 4. What is an echo and how is it produced?
**Answer**: An echo is the reflection of sound when it bounces off a surface and is heard after a delay. It occurs when sound waves hit a large, hard surface and are reflected back to the listener.

### 5. Explain resonance in sound.
**Answer**: Resonance occurs when an object vibrates at its natural frequency due to external vibrations, amplifying the sound. An example is a tuning fork vibrating when exposed to sound of the same frequency.

### 6. How is the loudness of sound measured?
**Answer**: The loudness of sound is measured in decibels (dB). It depends on the amplitude of the sound wave; the larger the amplitude, the louder the sound.

### 7. Difference between noise and musical sound.
- **Noise**: Irregular and disordered sound vibrations.
- **Musical Sound**: Regular and harmonious sound vibrations that are pleasant to hear.

### 8. What are the applications of ultrasound?
**Answer**: Ultrasound is used in medical imaging (like ultrasounds to view a fetus), cleaning delicate objects, and in sonar for detecting underwater objects.
