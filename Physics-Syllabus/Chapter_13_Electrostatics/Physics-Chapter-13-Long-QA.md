# Physics Chapter 13: Sound

## Long Questions and Answers

### 1. Explain how sound travels through different mediums and how its speed varies.
**Answer**:
Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel. The speed of sound depends on the medium’s density, elasticity, and temperature. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This is because molecules in solids are packed closely together, allowing sound waves to transmit more quickly.

#### Speed of Sound in Different Media:
- **Air (at 20°C)**: 343 m/s
- **Water**: 1,480 m/s
- **Steel**: 5,960 m/s

Factors affecting the speed of sound include:
- **Temperature**: Sound travels faster at higher temperatures because the molecules move more rapidly.
- **Medium**: Sound travels faster in denser mediums like water and solids due to close molecule spacing.

### 2. Discuss the Doppler Effect and provide real-life applications.
**Answer**:
The Doppler Effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the wave source. It occurs when a source of sound moves towards or away from an observer, causing a noticeable change in pitch.

#### Real-Life Applications:
1. **Radar Guns**: Used by police to detect the speed of moving vehicles.
2. **Ultrasound Imaging**: Used in medical imaging to monitor blood flow and the motion of body organs.
3. **Astronomy**: Astronomers use the Doppler Effect to determine the movement of stars and galaxies, indicating if they are moving towards or away from Earth.

### 3. Define resonance and explain its importance in sound production and technology.
**Answer**:
Resonance occurs when an object is forced to vibrate at its natural frequency by an external source, resulting in a large increase in amplitude. This is why musical instruments can produce loud and sustained sounds when they resonate.

#### Importance of Resonance:
1. **Musical Instruments**: Resonance amplifies the sound of musical instruments, such as guitars and pianos.
2. **Bridges and Buildings**: Engineers must consider resonance when designing structures. If a building resonates with the frequency of an earthquake, it can lead to catastrophic failure.
3. **Radio Tuning**: Radio receivers use resonance to tune into specific frequencies.
