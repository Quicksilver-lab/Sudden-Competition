# Academic Competition 📚

Welcome to the **Stuff** for my academic competition! 🎯 This repository is my one-stop-shop for all the important questions, answers, and concepts I’ll need to dominate the exams. I'm covering **Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Math, and English** based on the **Sudden-Competition** syllabus.

## The Story of How I Got Here... 🤷‍♂️

So, there I was, sitting around minding my own business, and BAM! Suddenly, I’m roped into a high-stakes academic competition where I need to score **95% marks** in **5 subjects**! 😳 You know, casual stuff. Didn’t even think twice before agreeing because why not, right?

But then it hit me… *95% marks?* Oh boy, now I actually have to study like never before! And because I love to make things fun (even when my brain is about to explode), I’ve decided to create this **super cool repo** to help me (and maybe you?) prepare.

## How I Accidentally Signed Up for the 95% Survival Challenge... 😅

> It was a totally normal Wednesday evening. My academy starts at 4 pm, but being the absolute master of punctuality that I am, I decided to roll in at around 6 pm. Fashionably late, right? Well, not so much. As soon as I entered, I noticed something different. There was a results announcement happening, and I had no idea because I’d just joined the academy a few weeks ago. Oh, the joys of being the new guy! 🤦‍♂️

> Now, here's where it gets interesting—both branches (boys and girls) were in the same building for the first time. Normally, we’re separated, which keeps things less dramatic, but not today. So, I’m riding in on my bike, and I swear it felt like a scene straight out of a movie. Picture this: on my right, a line of girls; on my left, a line of boys. And there I am in the middle, cruising down the aisle on my bike like some villain making his grand entrance. 🎥 Cue slow-motion music.

> I parked my bike (with the grace of someone who has absolutely no idea what's happening), locked it (because I totally trust the universe to mess with me), and stood at the back of the boys' side. Now, here’s the kicker: the girls were absolutely destroying us in every subject... except English. At least we had that. Small victories, am I right?

> So, the results announcement wraps up, and just as I’m thinking I’ve survived this awkward situation, the teacher drops a bombshell: “Alright, boys! Who thinks they can score 95% in the next competition? Step forward.” And boom! Like clockwork, a bunch of front-row nerds scurried forward like they’d been training for this moment their entire lives. Meanwhile, I’m at the back, looking like I just stumbled into the wrong party, still wearing my bag because, well, I’m that guy. 😅

> Then it hit me: Why not? I mean, taking risks is basically my hobby. Just last month, I entered a 12 km marathon on a whim and ended up spending the whole week in bed because my legs decided to take a vacation after running that far. So, naturally, I thought, “Let’s do this! Maybe I’ll actually study for once.” Because, let’s face it, without a competition, I’d probably end up watching Netflix instead of flipping through books.

> So, with all the dramatic flair of a backbencher suddenly deciding to conquer the world, I stepped forward. And let me tell you, it felt like I was walking toward the battlefield after single-handedly winning a war. The whole “movie villain” vibe from earlier? Yeah, it was back.

> But here’s the real twist: just as I’m standing there, basking in my newfound sense of accomplishment, the teacher says, “Girls, you too! Come forward!” And at that moment, I realized: I. Am. Screwed. 💀

> Turns out, we’re all in for it now—8 boys (including me, naturally) and a bunch of super-smart girls (I lost count, too busy freaking out) are now in a full-on competition, starting 1st October. And the goal? A glorious, shiny 95% in 5 subjects. Yep, you heard that right.

> And now, the reality is sinking in... I’ve got to actually study. Wish me luck, because, let’s be real, I’m gonna need it. 😂

## Motivation to Keep Going! 🚀

This is going to be a ride, but we’re not backing down. Between endless cups of tea ☕ and some much-needed breaks (Netflix, anyone? 🎬), we’re going to crack this. So grab your notes, power up that brain, and let’s hit that **95%** like we were born for it. Who said we can’t be both funny and awesome? 😎

Let’s do this!
