# Chapter 1: Introduction to Programming

## Detailed Concepts

### 1.1 What is Programming?
Computers need to be fed a series of instructions by humans to perform a particular task. These series of instructions are known as a computer program or software. The process of feeding or storing instructions in the computer is known as computer programming, and the person who knows how to write a computer program correctly is called a programmer.

### 1.2 Programming Languages
Computer programs are written in languages called programming languages. Some commonly known programming languages are:
- Java
- C
- C++
- Python

### 1.3 Programming Environment
A collection of all the necessary tools for programming makes up a programming environment. It provides the basic platform to write and execute programs.

### 1.4 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
A software that provides a programming environment and facilitates programmers in writing and executing computer programs is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### 1.5 Text Editor
A text editor is a software that allows programmers to write and edit computer programs. All IDEs have their own specific editors.

### 1.6 Compiler
A compiler is responsible for converting a computer program written in a programming language into machine language code.

### 1.7 Programming Syntax
Every programming language has some primitive building blocks and follows grammar rules known as its syntax.

### 1.8 Reserved Words / Keywords
Programming languages have a list of words that are predefined, and each word has a specific meaning known to the compiler. These words are known as reserved words or keywords.

### 1.9 Program Structure
A program is divided into three parts:
- **Header Section**: This is where the header files are included.
- **Main Section**: Corresponds to the main function.
- **Body of Main Function**: Includes everything enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

### 1.10 Comments
Comments are statements that are ignored by the compiler and do not get executed. They are used to include additional information about the program.

### 1.11 Constants
Constants are values that do not change. The three types of constants are:
1. Integer Constants
2. Real Constants
3. Character Constants

### 1.12 Variables
A variable is a name given to a memory location where data is physically stored inside the computerâ€™s memory. Each variable has a unique name (identifier) and an associated data type that describes the type of constant that can be stored in that variable.

### 1.13 Variable Declaration and Initialization
- A variable must be declared before its use. Declaration includes specifying the variable's data type and giving it a valid name.
- Assigning a value to a variable for the first time is called variable initialization. This can be done at the time of declaration or after the declaration.
