# Chapter 1: Introduction to Programming

## Q3: Define the following

### 1. IDE
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is software that provides a programming environment, which helps a programmer to write, debug, and execute code efficiently. It includes a text editor, a compiler, and debugging tools.

### 2. Compiler
A compiler is a software that translates a computer program written in a high-level programming language into machine language, so that the computer can execute the program.

### 3. Reserved Words
Reserved words (or keywords) are predefined words in a programming language that have a specific meaning to the compiler. These cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.

### 4. Main Section of a Program
The main section of a C program contains the `main()` function, which is the starting point of execution for every C program. All the executable code resides within the curly braces of the main function.

### 5. char Data Type
The `char` data type in C is used to store single characters like 'a', 'b', or symbols such as '!', '$'. It typically requires one byte of memory and represents values using ASCII codes.

## Q4: Briefly answer the following questions

### 1. Why do we need a programming environment?
A programming environment, such as an IDE, provides the necessary tools like a text editor, compiler, and debugger in one place, making the process of writing, compiling, and debugging programs efficient and user-friendly.

### 2. Write the steps to create a C program file in the IDE of your lab computer.
1. Open the IDE.
2. Create a new project or file.
3. Select the C programming language.
4. Write your code in the provided editor window.
5. Save the file with a `.c` extension.
6. Compile and execute the program using the build or run button.

### 3. Describe the purpose of a compiler.
The purpose of a compiler is to convert source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code so that the computer can understand and execute the instructions.

### 4. List down five reserved words in C programming language.
1. `int`
2. `char`
3. `return`
4. `if`
5. `else`

### 5. Discuss the main parts of the structure of a C program.
A typical C program consists of:
- **Header section**: Includes header files like `#include <stdio.h>`.
- **Main section**: Contains the `main()` function where execution begins.
- **Body of main**: Contains the actual program logic enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

### 6. Why do we use comments in programming?
Comments are used to add explanations, clarifications, or notes in the code that are ignored by the compiler. They help improve code readability and make it easier to understand for future reference.

### 7. Differentiate between constants and variables.
- **Constants**: Values that do not change during program execution (e.g., `const int MAX = 100;`).
- **Variables**: Named memory locations that store data, and their values can change during program execution (e.g., `int age = 25;`).

### 8. Write down the rules for naming variables.
1. A variable name must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
2. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores but no spaces or special characters.
3. It cannot start with a digit.
4. Reserved words cannot be used as variable names.
5. Variable names are case-sensitive.

### 9. Differentiate between char and int.
- **char**: Used to store a single character or symbol and requires 1 byte of memory (e.g., `char grade = 'A';`).
- **int**: Used to store integer values, typically requiring 2 or 4 bytes of memory (e.g., `int age = 20;`).

### 10. How can we declare and initialize a variable?
A variable can be declared and initialized in the following way:
- Declaration: `int age;`
- Initialization: `age = 25;`
- Combined: `int age = 25;`
