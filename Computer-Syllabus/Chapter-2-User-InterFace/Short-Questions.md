# Chapter 2: User Interface

## Short Questions and Answers

### Q.3 Define the following:

#### 1) Statement Terminator:
A **statement terminator** in C language is a symbol used to indicate the end of a statement. In C, the semicolon (`;`) is used as the statement terminator.

#### 2) Format Specifier:
A **format specifier** is used to specify the data type during input and output operations in C. It is always preceded by a percentage sign (`%`). For example, `%d` is used for integers, and `%f` for floating-point numbers.

#### 3) Escape Sequence:
An **escape sequence** is a combination of characters that represents a special action in a string, such as moving to the next line or inserting a tab. Examples include `\n` (new line) and `\t` (tab).

#### 4) scanf:
The **scanf** function is used to take input from the user in C language. It reads formatted input and stores the value in variables.

#### 5) Modulus Operator:
The **modulus operator** (`%`) is used in arithmetic operations to find the remainder when one number is divided by another. It works only with integer data types.

### Q.4 Briefly answer the following questions:

#### 1) What is the difference between scanf and getch?
- **scanf** is used to take input from the user and store it in variables, while **getch** is used to capture a single character input without displaying it on the screen.

#### 2) Which function of C language is used to display output on screen?
- The **printf** function is used in C language to display output on the screen.

#### 3) Why are format specifiers important in I/O operations?
- Format specifiers are important because they tell the program the type of data being entered or displayed, ensuring correct interpretation during input and output operations.

#### 4) What are escape sequences? Why do we need them?
- **Escape sequences** are special character combinations that provide specific formatting actions, such as moving to a new line (`\n`) or inserting a tab (`\t`). They help control the output format in a more readable manner.

#### 5) Which operators are used for arithmetic operations?
- The operators used for arithmetic operations in C are `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus).

#### 6) What are relational operators? Describe with an example.
- **Relational operators** are used to compare two values. For example, the operator `>` checks if one value is greater than another. If `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the expression `a > b` would return true.

#### 7) What are logical operators? Describe with an example.
- **Logical operators** are used to perform logical operations on Boolean expressions. For example, `&&` (logical AND) returns true if both expressions are true. If `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the expression `(a == 1 && b == 1)` would return true.

#### 8) What is the difference between unary operators and binary operators?
- **Unary operators** require only one operand (e.g., `-a` to negate `a`), while **binary operators** require two operands (e.g., `a + b` to add `a` and `b`).

#### 9) What is the difference between == operator and = operator?
- The **`==` operator** is used for comparison, checking if two values are equal, while the **`=` operator** is used for assignment, assigning a value to a variable.

#### 10) What is meant by precedence of operators? Which operator has the highest precedence in C language?
- **Precedence of operators** refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. In C language, the **parentheses `()`** have the highest precedence.
