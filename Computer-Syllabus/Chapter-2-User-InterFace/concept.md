# Chapter 2: Input and Output in C

## Overview
Chapter 2 covers the essential concepts related to input and output (I/O) operations in the C programming language. This includes the use of functions like `printf`, `scanf`, escape sequences, format specifiers, and various operators. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for writing programs that interact with users and perform calculations based on input data.

## Key Concepts
1. **Input and Output Functions**
   - `printf`: Used to display output to the screen.
   - `scanf`: Used to take input from the user.
   - `getch`: A function to get a character input without echoing it on the screen.

2. **Format Specifiers**
   Format specifiers are placeholders used in `printf` and `scanf` to indicate the type of data being processed. Examples include `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, and `%c` for characters.

3. **Escape Sequences**
   Escape sequences are special characters used to represent actions like new lines (`\n`), tabs (`\t`), or backspaces (`\b`). They are essential for formatting output properly.

4. **Operators**
   - **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
   - **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
   - **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
   - **Unary and Binary Operators**: Operators that work on one (`!`, `++`) or two operands (`+`, `-`).

5. **Operator Precedence**
   The rules that define the order in which operations are performed in an expression. For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

## Questions
Refer to the **[Questions.md](Short-Questions.md)** file for short questions, answers, and explanations related to the key concepts in Chapter 2.

## Programming Exercises
Chapter 2 includes a variety of programming exercises designed to practice input and output handling, operator usage, and problem-solving with C programs. Each exercise helps to reinforce the understanding of I/O and operator functionality in real-world scenarios.
